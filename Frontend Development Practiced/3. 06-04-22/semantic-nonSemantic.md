## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of semantic and non-semantic HTML elements to create a simple webpage. Semantic elements are used to provide meaning and structure to the content, making it clear to both developers and browsers. Non-semantic elements, on the other hand, are utilized for layout and styling purposes.

## Semantic Example

The `semantic-example.html` file showcases the use of semantic HTML elements to structure different sections of a webpage. It includes:

- `<header>` for the website title.
- `<nav>` for navigation links.
- `<main>` for the main content area.
- `<article>` and `<section>` for specific content sections.
- `<aside>` for additional information.
- `<footer>` for the footer section.

## Non-Semantic Example

The `non-semantic-example.html` file demonstrates the use of non-semantic HTML elements for layout and styling. It includes the use of `<div>` elements as generic containers without conveying specific meaning about the content.
